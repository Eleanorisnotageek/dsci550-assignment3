Ada,United States,"Ada witch - Sometimes you can see a misty blue figure floating within a 3-mile radius of the Ada Cemetery on 2 Mile between Egypt Valley and Honey Creek. The story of her origin is as follows: A man suspected his wife of having an affair, so he followed her late one night when she thought he was asleep. Sure enough, she went to a field near their property where she met her lover. The husband was enraged and killed his wife, which resulted in a struggle with the other man. Both men died from their injuries. It is said that late at night (especially during the night of and the nights preceding a full moon) people driving by the field can see her ghost, searching for her lover. Some people have reported stopping to try to communicate with her, but she always disappears or runs into the woods where she cannot be followed (due to the thick brambles that inhabit the area). She is said to dress in a long white gown which authorities say dates her to the turn of the 20th century. Usually she is seen alone, but sometimes witnesses report seeing a ghostly death scene re-enacted... Others report seeing nothing at all but hearing the killer's shouts of rage followed by the victims' screams of agony... Although it is said she haunts the field on Honeycreek Road where she died, other witnesses have reported her in nearby Seidman Park, and in nearby Findlay Cemetery, where she is supposedly buried. This story was actually featured in the book ""Ghosts of Grand Rapids.""",Ada Cemetery,Michigan,MI,-85.50489309999999,42.9621061,-85.4954803,42.960727,True,True,2025/03/03,8,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"4,548",25.5,5.75,19.8%,5.6,7.9,1.8,4.3,40.2%,67.9%,59.6%,40.4%,84.4%,2.57%,115890.0,8.162,11.018,2.84,50251.92857142857,632.2142857142857,289907.0714285714,123.0,121.0,Above Average,734.0,324.0,165.0,80.0,56.0,31.0,78.0,11.83,Ada_witch___Sometimes_you_can_see_a_misty_blue_fig.png,a group of people standing on top of a lush green field .,"mailbox, letter box (0.23), park bench (0.13), West Highland white terrier (0.10), ashcan, trash can, garbage can, wastebin, ash bin, ash-bin, ashbin, dustbin, trash barrel, trash bin (0.09), picket fence, paling (0.05)","['ORG', 'QUANTITY', 'FAC', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'DATE', 'FAC', 'FAC', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART']","['Ada witch -', '3-mile', 'the Ada Cemetery', 'Egypt Valley', 'Honey Creek', 'late one night', 'late at night', 'the night', 'the turn of the 20th century', 'Honeycreek Road', 'Seidman Park', 'Findlay Cemetery', 'Ghosts of Grand Rapids']",Ada Cemetery,42.96252,-85.50474,"mailbox, letter box (0.23), park bench (0.13), West Highland white terrier (0.10), ashcan, trash can, garbage can, wastebin, ash bin, ash-bin, ashbin, dustbin, trash barrel, trash bin (0.09), picket fence, paling (0.05)"
Addison,United States,A little girl was killed suddenly while waiting for a school bus by a speeding car. Since her death things have happened. The day of her funeral she started knocking on doors of the house she was born in.1 month later as her clothes were to be removed the doors in the home flew open with no reason. Cold spots now can be felt & knocking at the door is still present to this day in the home. Also when there swings in the yard you could see them swing real high as if someone was swinging on them. lights like to go on & off in this home & she does move things to let someone know she is there. The cemetery where this child lies has had alot of activity also. When you visit her grave she has a twirly that will start going around & round with no reason or wind blowing to let you know she is present.

Adrian,United States,"If you take Gorman Rd. west towards Sand Creek, you will come to a gravel road leading north. A mile or so up this road you will come to narrow one lane trestle bridge. The road goes under this. Legend has it that at one time there was a farm house built near the tracks. Late one night a fire broke out in the barn. While the father ran to the barn to try to get the horses out, his wife and young son went to the tracks to wave down one of the many trains that would use that right of way. They were too close to the tracks however and both were struck by the train as it went past. The father was killed in the barn. Now if you go out there late at night, you can sometimes communicate with the Father. He will not allow you to talk to his wife or son; as if he was protecting them . There are other people living in the area now, and a large streetlight has been placed there by the people who own the neighboring land. If you stay there to long, they will call the police. However if you make your visit short enough they will usually leave you to it. This place has also been described as a good place to go to contact other spirits. The Father can be asked to help in this matter.

Adrian,United States,"In the 1970's, one room, room 211, in the old section of the dorms exhibited several phenomena. Don't know if this still continues today. The door into the room from the hallway, as well as the door into the bathroom, would open and shut on their own, the main door even if it had been locked. After closing, it would be locked again. There was also a spot on one wall (a wall that the room shared with a boarded up, no longer used laundry shaft) where two points of light would appear, shaped similar to eyes. Attempts were made to explain their appearance (they were visible any time it was dark in the room). They were screened off from the windows to see if they might be reflections, they weren't. When objects were placed between them and the windows they actually became brighter. We tried painting the walls, putting several coats of paint over them (thinking they may have been a joke of a previous resident, made with glow in the dark paint) - also having used sandpaper on the wall in that spot first before painting. They still appeared bright as ever after the painting. We tried covering them over by hanging a picture over them, but the picture kept falling down or moving. Last attempt to hang picture (it was a drawing on a piece of paper and simply taped to the wall) resulted in us waking up the next morning to find it taped to the ceiling over my bed. We finally moved a tall dresser in front of it and that seemed to take care of it. Reports from later residents told us that they had placed a mirror over it, and they had a rocker in the room. One night during a party, with several witnesses, the rocker began rocking on its own, then flew back and smashed the mirror. Have had no contact with the school since graduation, so don't know if these things still happen or not.",Siena Heights University,Michigan,MI,-84.0175653,41.9057124,-84.03716589999999,41.8975471,False,True,1919/03/13,0,Morning,Other (Male),Accident,"4,548",25.5,5.75,19.8%,5.6,7.9,1.8,4.3,40.2%,67.9%,59.6%,40.4%,84.4%,2.57%,115890.0,8.162,11.018,2.84,50251.92857142857,632.2142857142857,289907.0714285714,123.0,121.0,Above Average,734.0,324.0,165.0,80.0,56.0,31.0,78.0,11.83,In_the_1970_s__one_room__room_211__in_the_old_sect.png,a black and white photo of a bathroom .,"sliding door (0.43), wardrobe, closet, press (0.11), doormat, welcome mat (0.08)","['DATE', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'ORDINAL', 'TIME', 'TIME']","['1970', 'one', '211', 'today', 'one', 'two', 'first', 'the next morning', 'One night']",Sterling Heights,42.58031,-83.0302,"sliding door (0.43), wardrobe, closet, press (0.11), doormat, welcome mat (0.08)"

Central Lake,United States,"The Lamplights Inn has been a landmark in Central Lake since 1924. It was built in the very early 1900s. Beginning in the early '50s, the successive owners have had persistent reports of ghosts. A man and woman dressed in late '20s - early '30s garb have been seen many times over the years, not only by owners' families, but also by employees and customers alike. The descriptions are uncannily similar. A customer recently reported the man and woman ghosts dancing together in the bar area with a little girl ghost looking on. These ghosts also window peep (on the second floor). They certainly appear to be fun loving. Another story tells of the daughter of a former hotel manager, who was preparing to elope with her fiancée, and tripped on her gown while descending the ladder. She fell to her death and returns to walk the hallway upstairs in her wedding gown. And, it is a fact that Mrs. Gill who, with her husband, were the first managers of the hotel, returned and lived out her remaining years at the hotel. She died in the early '50s in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Many people have reported seeing her stand in the upstairs window looking onto the village. In 1979 Ted Strzempek bought the lamplight he said he was in the upstairs hallway painting when a women in a white dress ran by him and through all the boxes he had stacked by the wall she ran into a bedroom and he ran in after her only to find an empty room.

Clinton Township,United States,"There have been several acts of violence here. About 20 years ago a man escaped from a mental home and broke into the front office. In the process he broke several windows, trashed the place, slit his wrists and neck, and was found by the sales staff in the morning wrapped in a blanket talking to himself. He did not die but it was a very violent experience. 10 or so years ago a man was distressed over losing his parents and shot himself in the head overnight on top of his parent s grave. Several of the grounds crew have seen a man dematerialize in the same area a few times. This was in the summit hill garden which is the oldest garden in the cemetery. In the day or night there can be an overwhelming feeling of being watched. About 6 or 7 years ago there was a sales manager who quit after seeing an Indian in the sales office walk thru a wall. There is also a story not verified that a police officer shot a teenager on the grounds and the boy died and was buried there.

Harrison,United States,"There are many stories about this house. One is the mother (Mrs. Reinke) was standing in her kitchen putting away groceries, and looked up and saw twin daughters (around 6 years old) holding hands and walking toward her. They walked right past her and out the door down towards Budd Lake. Another story is the large man story. Mr. Reinke was tying up his boat when he looked up into his bedroom window and saw a large figure of a man in the window. He rushed up to make sure everything was ok and when he got there, nothing was in the room. Soon after, another sighting of this large man happened. The daughter was sleeping when she noticed that a light was coming from her closet. The way the light comes through the window it would be impossible to be shining into the closet. She looked away, and when she looked back, saw a large man in her closet, the same man her dad had seen earlier. She described the man looking just the way her dad had seen, and he hadn't told anyone about the man yet (he didn't want to look stupid). The next day, the whole family was out of the house, and no one had been there all day. When the daughter came home, she found her room in total shambles, everything in the closet had been thrown around, and figurines and other possessions where seen lying on the ground. Another story has to do with the son. One night he could hear a bouncing ball in the attic above his room. He hears it about once every month or so, and if he gets annoyed with it, he tells the ghost or whatever is bouncing the ball to quit, and it usually does. He is very used to it, and it doesn't scare him anymore to hear it.

Lambertville,United States,"Verna Drive - Update: The following reported haunting is a hoax.- The Monroe County Paranormal Society have just investigated this claim and their contacts in the sheriff's department tell them that there has never been such a murder in the entire county, let alone in the quiet of Bedford Township. Also Lambert Estates also has never existed. One also has to wonder how such a horrific tragedy as the game show story never even made it to the local news. - Off Monroe Road in Lambertville, Michigan, there is a subdivision called Lambert Estates. Lambert Estates is mostly made up of a road called Verna Drive. The subdivision was formed in 1957. In the early summer of 1978, Steven Madison, a 33-year-old worker for a glass plant in Toledo, Ohio, walked into a home on Verna Drive and killed an elderly couple with a hammer found in the garage. He then moved into several other houses that night, and killed 7 others. 3 male adults, 1 female adult, 2 male children, and 2 female children. He used a block of firewood to kill a family of 3, a wood saw to kill a young college graduate, and smothered or strangled the other 3. He then went into the woods next to the neighborhood and hung himself from a maple tree. Reports of screams often come from two houses in the neighborhood. In the early July's, residents report a figure of a man walking down the street carrying a piece of firewood wearing a green shirt and jeans that appear to be blood stained. A neighbor once approached the man after seeing him 3 consecutive nights. When the man was asked who he was, he turned and faced the resident with a frightening wide grin and wide eyes. He walked off after not responding and disappeared in the front yard of an residents house. He was also reported seen in the woods, hanging from a tree, when the owner of the woods walked in one evening while walking his dog. He noticed nothing out of the ordinary at first, until when standing under a tree; drops of water fell on him. He looked up and saw him hanging by his neck as if he just died. The water was apparently tears that the man shed. An investigation was conducted to investigate the level of paranormal activity. The investigation was part of a game show where a group of people spent a week in the now abandoned neighborhood, to determine whether it was haunted. By the end of the week, a member of the investigating team disappeared and had not been found until two months later. He was found nearly dead in the glass plant in Toledo wear Steven Madison was employed. To this day the neighborhood remains empty, yet still stands. - June 2008 Update - The first posting for Lambert estates indicates it is abandoned. The update then states that the neighborhood never existed. Actually, not only has it existed, it remains very much occupied to this day. Every house is very well maintained. However, it is not in Temperance, it is in Lambertville, the next town over.",formerly listed in Temperance,Michigan,MI,-83.62601099999999,41.75810800000001,-83.624201,41.75290880000001,True,True,1957/03/13,2,Evening,Ghost (Male),Murder,"4,548",25.5,5.75,19.8%,5.6,7.9,1.8,4.3,40.2%,67.9%,59.6%,40.4%,84.4%,2.57%,115890.0,8.162,11.018,2.84,50251.92857142857,632.2142857142857,289907.0714285714,123.0,121.0,Above Average,734.0,324.0,165.0,80.0,56.0,31.0,78.0,11.83,Verna_Drive___Update__The_following_reported_haunt.png,a red and white fire hydrant in front of a house .,"church, church building (0.32), picket fence, paling (0.29), flagpole, flagstaff (0.14), beacon, lighthouse, beacon light, pharos (0.02), boathouse (0.02)","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'ORDINAL', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORDINAL', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE']","['Verna Drive - Update', 'Bedford Township', 'Lambert Estates', 'One', 'Lambertville', 'Michigan', 'Lambert Estates', 'Lambert Estates', 'Verna Drive', '1957', 'the early summer of 1978', 'Steven Madison', '33-year-old', 'Toledo', 'Ohio', 'Verna Drive', '7', '3', '1', '2', '2', '3', '3', 'two', ""the early July's"", '3 consecutive nights', 'one evening', 'first', 'a week', 'the end of the week', 'two months later', 'Toledo', 'Steven Madison', 'this day', 'June 2008', 'first', 'Lambert', 'this day', 'Temperance', 'Lambertville']",Lambertville,40.36594,-74.94294,"church, church building (0.32), picket fence, paling (0.29), flagpole, flagstaff (0.14), beacon, lighthouse, beacon light, pharos (0.02), boathouse (0.02)"

Manitoulin Island,United States,"- Drummond Island - Drummond Island is said to be haunted by two ghosts of headless British soldiers. During the War of 1812 there where two British soldiers who went AWOL, and a price was placed on their heads. Two Indians near the fort ran off on snowshoes to pursue the deserters. The deserters had built a fire to warm themselves on Manitoulin Island (in Canada now) and began to doze while sitting by their large blaze. The Indians snuck up behind them and with a few swift chops of their hatchets the soldiers were decapitated. The Indians brought their heads back to the fort and collected their bounty. Now people say sometimes you can see a fire burning on the shore and two headless figures pacing around it.

Marine City,United States,"Once in a great while employees of the kitchen claim that machines will turn on when no one is around, such as mixers, dishwasher, etc. The very rare occasions have pretty much stopped but just recently in the summer of 2003 a radio/C.D. player boombox was said to ""have a mind of it's own"". It started with the volume increasing by it's self over the corse of 5-10 minutes to the point where it was full blast and had to be turned down. But a little while later it would turn it's self up again, blaring loud and causing frusteration among employees. One Sunday morning during a busy breakfast rush, a frusterated employee turned the power button off since it wouldn't stay at a reasonable volume level. Minutes later the radio suddenly turned on loud as can be. The red-faced employee turned it off again, and five minutes later the words ""sugar, sugar, oh honey, honey!"" came blaring out of the speakers (the radio station was placed at 104.3, oldies station). The employee grabbed the radio, unplugged it and sat it underneath a table. This ended the incents for that day and the night crew workers claimed they had no problems with the radio at all after they plugged it in that same night. All week the radio was fine until Sunday morning came. The breakfast buffet near the dining room was getting busy and kitchen workers became busy as well. The radio started turning it's self up again. The same employee from last Sunday battled it for 2 hours having to turn the volume down every 10-15 minutes. Everyone thought it was broken or something. He eventually turned it off and became very frusterated. And about 20 minutes later, the song ""Edge Of Seventeen"" by Stevie Nicks suddenly blared from the radio. The employee stared at the radio shaking his head as workers yelled for him to turn it down. He gritted his teeth, unplugged it, and wrapped the cord around it. It remained silent and still for an hour until it suddenly ""hurled it's self towards him"" but missed him by a few inches and hit the floor. The radio was permanently shot and would not work after this incident. Other strange incidents involved objects disappearing (knives, utinsils, etc.) while employees were just using them seconds earlier. After searching the kitchen for them they would be neatly placed where the cooks had originally placed them. Also, the same employee that dealed with the radio incident claimed that vegetables such as squash, potatoes, etc. would be neatly placed on a cutting board but nobody needed them and would have to be put back. This also occured with other items. One time a 5-gallon jug of milk was found sitting on a table in the kitchen. After checking the milk machine it was full with milk. He asked around if anyone got the milk out. Puzzled, the waitresses said no. He placed the milk jug back in the walk in refrigerator. He began chopping up some vegetables when all of the sudden an entire shelf of pizza pans (about 15 inches wide and 30 inches high) fell spreading loud bobbling pizza pans all over the floor. Seconds later 3 metal hotel pans fell off a shelf causing a he racket. The frusterated employee walked out, but returned the next day for work. This was like the grand finale for the poltergeist, if it even was a poltergeist, because nothing has happened since for several months. These events started out of the blue and only lasted two weeks and then abruptly stopped. Even before they occured nothing unusual ever happened there for years.",Riviera Restaurant,Michigan,MI,-82.49271159999999,42.7146215,-82.492132,42.7194778,False,False,2003/03/13,0,Morning,Ghost (Male),Murder,"4,548",25.5,5.75,19.8%,5.6,7.9,1.8,4.3,40.2%,67.9%,59.6%,40.4%,84.4%,2.57%,115890.0,8.162,11.018,2.84,50251.92857142857,632.2142857142857,289907.0714285714,123.0,121.0,Above Average,734.0,324.0,165.0,80.0,56.0,31.0,78.0,11.83,Once_in_a_great_while_employees_of_the_kitchen_cla.png,a microwave oven sitting on top of a counter .,"tape player (0.68), cassette player (0.22), cassette (0.02), CD player (0.02)","['DATE', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'TIME', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'PERSON', 'TIME', 'QUANTITY', 'CARDINAL', 'QUANTITY', 'QUANTITY', 'QUANTITY', 'TIME', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']","['the summer of 2003', '5-10 minutes', 'One Sunday morning', 'Minutes later', 'five minutes later', '104.3', 'that day', 'All week', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'last Sunday', '2 hours', '10-15 minutes', 'about 20 minutes later', 'Edge Of Seventeen', 'Stevie Nicks', 'an hour', 'a few inches', 'One', '5-gallon', 'about 15 inches', '30 inches', 'Seconds', '3', 'the next day', 'several months', 'two weeks', 'years']",,,,"tape player (0.68), cassette player (0.22), cassette (0.02), CD player (0.02)"

Since this place was once a hot spot to dump bodies it has become very much haunted. There have been reports of screams coming from the junkyard during the night. Also many police reports have been done on the sighting of people standing by the road. When the motorist would stop to help these people they would be gone. One wild report states that the motorist believed he hit a person but no damage was found on the car. This Junk Yard has and is becoming a smoking hot spot for ghosts and Hauntings. The owner of the yard now makes sure the place is always closed before dark and there has been a for sale sign in front of this yard for more than three years going. No one wants to buy the property. - June 2008 Update/Correction: The pervious owner reports there were never any bodies found in the junkyard, but, another previous owner was murdered by his wife's boyfriend. The murder has been featured on court TV. The new owner does claim that there is some paranormal activity in the office where he was murdered at(doors slamming and odd noises).

Northville,United States,"In the old city of Northville in the 40's and 50's, were many insane asylums. They were not even a mile apart and ran through the whole town. They were all linked underneath the ground, for underground passages of very mentally ill patients and there's rumors that that's where many of the out of control patients were punished, not to alarm the others. The tunnels go all through the town, and under buildings, which are now on the place of the asylums. The tunnels are blocked off but the people who are brave enough to go in have experienced screaming, voices, moaning and orbs. Feelings of people behind you, crashes against the walls, and more. The tunnels are miles long and are tight compacted areas. There is a 200 dollar fine for anyone to go there, seeing as the late 80's and 90's brought many Satanists there trying to summon up spirits. -  Update: The buildings of the insane asylum have now been torn down and they are building a sub-division on the land.

Romulus,United States,"Off Van Born near Wayne Rd there is a warehouse complex that originally started out as Stinson Aviation. They built planes there in the 1930's. On the floor of the area are the initials of the workers who called themselves the ""Left Wing Gang"". Ironically, some of the initials are the exact same as those of workers who are there today. Legend has it that a wing fell from one of the planes and killed several workers there. After that, it was expanded and Detroit Diesel occupied it for years, where it is said a man committed suicide there. That part of the complex is now used by Ford Motor Co as a warehouse. At any time during the day and night you can hear voices and sounds as if people are working with tools like they are building something. Many times, they call out to you by your name, leaving workers to answer back to no one! Carts move all by themselves, and several of the workers have had their clothes tugged on and have been tapped on the back, only to find they are alone in the area.

Trenton,United States,"A family called the Church family built the old hospital in the 1800s. It was their house until they died and their other family members didn't want anything to do with the house, so Henry Ford bought the old house and turned it into a hospital in 1944. The kids included in the family were two boys and a 9-year-old girl. The 9-year old girl loved horses so they had five horses. So, in that case, there are horse stables in the back. The little girl loved her horse and rode it everyday. Until one day, the little girl fell off the horse and broke her arm. The dad got mad and thought it was the horse's fault that his little girl broke her arm. So while she was at school one day, her dad killed the horse for hurting his little girl. The dad and his friend buried the horse on the side of their house. If you go to the side of the house where the dad and his friend buried the horse, there will be a little hill where the horse is. When the little girl came home and found out what her dad did, everyday from then on, she would come home from school, lock hers in her room, put her rocking chair in front of her window and she would sing to herself. Well, when the family died and Henry Ford bought the house, that was then the hospital, there was an old man that was in the hospital and his hospital room was what used to be the little girl's bedroom. While he was lying there in his bed, he heard singing, then he heard footsteps. When he got out of the hospital, he had someone set up thermal cameras in the room he was in and sure enough, they saw a figure in front of the window. After Henry Ford bought the hospital, six doctors wanted to build a bigger one and that's how the newer Riverside Hospital came about. They ended up closing down the old hospital 5 years ago because they found black mold growing in the building, which can kill you. They closed down the newer hospital one year ago because it was too much to keep up. Also, the Henry Ford company wanted to move everything to Wyandotte so Riverside lost business. There is a stack by the hospital. In a little tunnel thing outside of the new hospital, there is a furnace type thing. That's where they burned the amputated body parts of people. Also in that little tunnel, is the old morgue. THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SEEN IN THE WINDOW THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOVE. SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE DRESS WITH BROWN CURLY HAIR AND BOWS IN HER HAIR.

Walled Lake,United States,"The shoe tree (previously mentioned in Salem) was on Thirteen Mile Rd. in Novi a quarter mile from Walled Lake, and from the site of the old Walled Lake amusement park. A child killer (the infamous Walled Lake Child Killer) kidnapped the children from the park, and buried their bodies in the nearby field around the tree. He threw their shoes into the tree. When the many dangling shoes were investigated, the bodies were found (but, the killer never was). If you went to the field at night, you could see and hear the clumps of tall grass moving around you, and you could hear the children cry for their mothers! Witnesses report very distinct, audible cries. The cries were not distant but, from just a few feet away. As you walked to where the cries came from, they seemed to move around. Not moving farther away, just around, sometimes back to where you were just standing. Just walking by the field would make your hair stand on end. The land was developed within the past couple of years. A subdivision now stands on this land. But, the field was on the south side of Thirteen Mile Rd., between Meadowbrook Rd., and Decker. The amusement park was later closed down. Not because of the murders but, because it rested on an old Indian burial ground (many in the area).

Altoona,United States,"Beulah Road -  This legend is a cross between the spectral hitchhiker stories you have heard before and the sort of ""Resurrection Mary"" type tales familiar to the Chicago area. the ghost of the white lady still walks at night. For historical background there used to be a hotel at the top of the Wopsononock Mountain that was a fairly common getaway for people in Altoona. The Wopsononock hotel and famous lookout burned in the early part of the 20th century and was never rebuilt. In fact, at one time it was serviced by a narrow gauge railroad know as the ""Alley Popper"" although that has nothing to do with this tale. The road heading up to the Wopsy Lookout (as it is known hereabouts) is now Juniata Gap road in Altoona. This road is a treacherous one bearing a curve known as the ""Devil's Elbow"" which has been the scene of many accidents. Apparently in the early part of the century a couple was married and was heading to the hotel at the lookout for their honeymoon. I know nothing of the father chasing them which is related to the Ebensburg tale you have given. The legend goes that they were both from Altoona and were heading up the road leading to the hotel when the carriage went over the edge rounding the Devil's Elbow. Both were apparently killed but the body of the husband was never recovered. Since then travelers on this road have encountered the specter of a woman in white, sometimes seen to be carrying a candle, who apparently is looking for something. Variations on the tale have her waylaying young men and looking them over to see if they are her husband, or hitching rides with young men headed for the top of the mountain and then disappearing near the Devil's Elbow. Apparently this spirit has also been seen on the road leading up the mountain where the lookout can be accessed from the other direction, Buckhorn Mountain, and she is also known as the ""White Lady of the Buckhorn"" as well as the ""White Lady of Wopsononock"". The site of the old hotel now is littered with television and radio towers and is still a sort of ""lover's lane"" spot for a lot of folks. Apparently some of the technicians at the towers have reported seeing her, but the most recent account (late 1990's) involved a man who offered her a ride. She apparently got into the car and he could not see her in the rear view mirror but could see her when he turned around. She said nothing to him and disappeared at the Devil's Elbow. Much like Resurrection Mary, it is a difficult tale to dispute since it has occurred so often to so many people over such a long stretch of time. Although the historical details are sketchy! No one knows who she was or when the accident actually took place. If you ever get a chance to get to this area take a trip on either road and you may get a chance to run into her.",Wapsononock Mountain,Pennsylvania,PA,,,-78.3947359,40.5186809,True,True,2025/03/13,4,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"5,703",26.2,5.52,18.5%,5.5,7.9,1.8,3.9,45.4%,69.0%,52.4%,47.6%,81.7%,2.67%,149637.0,9.544,12.885,2.59,48587.07142857143,670.5,288389.0714285714,128.0,121.0,Above Average,144.0,53.0,33.0,19.0,11.0,16.0,10.0,11.83,Beulah_Road____This_legend_is_a_cross_between_the.png,a black and white photo of a train track,"park bench (0.13), snowplow, snowplough (0.10), streetcar, tram, tramcar, trolley, trolley car (0.10), car mirror (0.04), chainlink fence (0.04)","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'TIME', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'CARDINAL', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'FAC', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON']","['Beulah Road -  ', 'Chicago', 'night', 'Altoona', 'the 20th century', 'one', 'the ""Alley Popper', 'the Wopsy Lookout', 'Juniata Gap', 'Altoona', 'the ""Devil\'s', 'Elbow', 'the century', 'Ebensburg', 'Altoona', 'Elbow', 'Devil', 'Elbow', 'Buckhorn Mountain', 'Buckhorn', 'White Lady of Wopsononock', ""late 1990's"", 'Devil', 'Elbow', 'Resurrection Mary']",City of Chicago,41.83691,-87.68475,"park bench (0.13), snowplow, snowplough (0.10), streetcar, tram, tramcar, trolley, trolley car (0.10), car mirror (0.04), chainlink fence (0.04)"

Bethlehem,United States,"Comenius Hall - At night you can see a light going back and forth across the top floor of this hall. It is said to be the ghost of the gentleman the hall is named after.March 2007 Additional information: Every Year, Moravian College celebrates Halloween with haunted houses and parties. One year, a haunted tour was given, with real and fake stories told along the route. As the tour was given, a friend was instructed to go ahead and turn off the basement lights for a walk through Comenius Hall. This was to give a more spooky affect. Three times he tried the lights and all three times, he watched the switch turn back on. After that, he abandoned the task and went back to the group. As the group descended to walk through the basement, one of the members of the group hesitated. He was blind and his guide dog was leading him. According to the man, the dog was signaling danger and trying to stop him from venturing into the basement.

Butler County,United States,"The old Mill turned state park is home to many spirits who still roam the hills and Slippery Rock Creek. When the mill was operational a man who worked there always walked the same path to work. He carried his lunch in a box and a lantern. Rumor is the man died because of a malfunction in the equipment. Some nights if you park your car right above the mill the man can be seen walking down the hill to mill. He goes into the mill a light seems to be on and screams are heard coming from the mill. There is also the spirit of a caretaker that lived on the property from the early 1930's until his death around 1960. Times he can be seen chasing people away from the land he loved and took care of. Legend has it that a girl died in auto accident on the covered bridge that crosses Slippery Rock Creek beside the mill. Stories say she can be summoned by parking your car in the middle of the bridge turning off the engine and lights and honking your horn 3 times. She is supposed to appear in your rear view mirror. Natural human reaction is to turn around and look but she's never there and disappears from the mirror. Many people have lost their lives in the treacherous Slippery Rock Creek, which is more of a river in the surrounding area. Numerous adventurous young people have drown in waters.

Several men were accused, arrested, and eventually hanged at the prison for being Molly Maguires. On the eve of his execution, a man who proclaimed his innocence ran his hand along the dirty floor of his cell and made an impression of his hand on the wall, claiming the impression would always remain as proof of his innocence. The next day, he was hung and the hand print was washed away. Three days later, the print reappeared. As legend has it, the wall has been repeatedly washed and painted, but the hand print always returns. The wall was supposedly even ripped down and re-plastered, but the hand print returned yet again. The prison is now opened to tourist, but the cell with the hand print is off limits. Visitors can still view the print through the cell door, though.",old Carbon County Prison,Pennsylvania,PA,-75.78172529999999,40.8775327,-75.667356,40.901975,False,True,1995/03/13,0,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Murder,"5,703",26.2,5.52,18.5%,5.5,7.9,1.8,3.9,45.4%,69.0%,52.4%,47.6%,81.7%,2.67%,149637.0,9.544,12.885,2.59,48587.07142857143,670.5,288389.0714285714,128.0,121.0,Above Average,144.0,53.0,33.0,19.0,11.0,16.0,10.0,11.83,Jim_Thorpe___The_old_Carbon_County_Prison_was_last.png,a black and white photo of a building,"prison, prison house (0.94)","['PERSON', 'FAC', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE']","['Jim Thorpe - The', 'Carbon County Prison', '1995', 'recent years', 'the Molly Maguires', 'The Molly Maguires', '1870', 'Molly Maguires', 'The next day', 'Three days later']",Carbon County,40.91818,-75.70882,"prison, prison house (0.94)"

Drexel Hill,United States,"Originally the old Drexel Estate and then later before the school an orphanage- there are 2 tales here. The 1st is the story of an orphan that was murdered by another. On the second floor of the school there are still 2 halls left with the original bedrooms- still not converted to classrooms. The halls are on the same floor as the chapel. Students have claimed to see furniture move in those rooms. There is 1 old rocking horse in particular that will ALWAYS MOVE ON ITS OWN when the room is occupied for too long. Because of the hostile vibe felt in that room, people believe that is the spirit of the murdering orphan, who also died there due to a ""freak"" accident. There are also reports of students seeing two children late at night, running, fighting, and screaming through those halls. The 2nd story is the tale of a nun who taught at the orphanage. She hung herself in the bell tower and haunts it to this day. Many times the bell will ring unexpectedly and late at night a light will go on and off. Unlike the modern light that is suppose to be up there (which seems to always mysteriously short out), it looks like a candle. Students who have tried to get up there have been spooked severely.

Duncannon,United States,"Amity Hall Hotel - Amity Hall - There was a young woman found stabbed to death laying on the front porch on a couch. The legend has it that there was a family that lived in it and the husband went crazy and killed his wife, then his kids, then himself in the upstairs hallways/rooms of the hotel. IN the days of the PA Canal system, canal travelers used to stay there, then in the civil war days it was used as a hospital. - IF planning to visit this place – try to get permission - it says no trespassing When you get permission bring plenty of batteries, because they drain quickly. In the corner of the L-shaped building, very small bluish lights have been. The creepier place on the outside is a door at the end of a hall which is locked shut. The worst room in the house is upstairs, the trophy room. This room is filled with a giant feeling of ""GET OUT OF HERE"". The glass and mirrors are all broken. Very faint white figure of what appears to be a woman in the attic window facing the parking lot can be seen. white flashes of light in the attic windows facing the road have been seen. Faint glows fading in and out of the windows, as well as small but somewhat bright points of light coming from the corner of the L-shape. Frightening black figures, not the shape of a dog, but about the size of a dog, linger in the parking lot. (I believe they are called imps) A particularly vengeful spirit has sat outside of cars in which males are present.

There's no name on it, but you can tell that there used to be one. It also has a lot of vampire like designs on it. The other area is called the Witches Circle. It is a group of tombstones that are in the shape of a circle. Some of them are burnt black. Legend has it that Satan came to get his loyal followers. The burns are supposed to be from the fires of Hell. It has been tried repeatedly to get the scorch marks off of the tombstones, but it doesn't ever come off. I've inspected these stones myself and tried to read what they said on them. One had some pretty weird stuff on it. You get chills and hear walking behind you while at this cemetery.

Gettysburg,United States,"Sigma Nu Fraternity House - This house was previously owned by the only doctor in the county through the depression era. He died in the house.

The lights have dimmed out in the bedroom where the doctor died, while the lights in the hallway have stayed lit, and they're both on the same circuit. Sounds of things being thrown around in the basement in the dark, but the noise stops when the lights are turned on, and nothing is out of place. Once during a storm over a break, one of two people in the house heard the front door slam open, they went downstairs, closed the door, only to turn around and see wet footsteps on the carpet. Noises of walking upstairs were then heard. The person raced upstairs to find more wet footprints. The person chased the noised and footprints through the house. As the person chased the noised through the only hallway on the 3rd floor, when the other person was studying in the hallway, the studying person said that nobody had passed by, yet they both then heard the noises going down the stairs. They then heard the front door slam open again, and the footprints had exited the house.

Harrisburg,United States,"Harrisburg State Hospital was an insane asylum for over 150 years. It admitted its first patient in 1851 as The Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital. It is located on the outskirts of city limits of Harrisburg on a 200 acre plot, most of which falls within Susquehanna Township lines. There is an entrance on Cameron St. across from the Farm Show complex and another one off of Elmerton Ave. A hiking and biking trail called the Capital Area Green Belt leads into another entrance in the Edgemont area of the city. It closed its doors as an asylum in 2006, but the grounds and buildings are still in use today as offices for several state agencies such as the PA Office of Mental Health. There are now over 50 buildings on the grounds, although a large portion of the land is still Woodland. Many different noises from screams to footsteps are heard and many different visuals ranging from shadows to full-bodied apparitions are witnessed. The morgue, although very tiny, is 2 stories tall and the basement leads into the tunnels. There are large blood-like stains on the floor and all the exam tables are still there. There is also poltergeist activity reported in the various buildings. Be warned, it may be illegal to be on the property at night and there are some security guards. The morgue, stables, and some of the tunnel entrances are secluded enough to probably not be noticed if entered at night, and since that area is right by the Green Belt, one could enter the property from that entrance and have the car readily available, but it is probably best to try and get permission.

Lebanon County,United States,"Green Point - Moonshine church & Cemetery - Driving up the hill(Rt.443) to the church at night(church on the left/cemetery on the right) IF you dare to stop(especially at Halloween) around midnight chances your car will shut offWeird noises can be heard around the whole area. Among various paranormal phenomena, the most commonly reported is that of car engines cutting out when being driven past the cemetery. Also it's said that a girl went into the church and said The Lord's Prayer backwards and was struck dead by lightening. Also in and around the same area(Indiantown Gap),it's said that The ""Headless Horseman"" rides through the valley looking for a new head. - March 2005 Correction: Earlier submitted that you see blue eyes in the trees at the end of the cemetery, supposedly the ""Blue-Eyed Six"" were hung there for murdering a man. The cemetery at this church is said to be haunted by the Blue-Eyed Six, a gang that murdered a local man and whose members were all subsequently hung in the cemetery as punishment(a play has been written about this event and was possibly copyrighted). This information is NOT TRUE. The Blue Eyed Six were never related in any way to the church or it's cemetery. Although all these things occured within this area more or less. They never were hung in the cemetery or buried there, nor is it believed they would have any reason to haunt this place as they have no worldy connections.

Livermore,United States,"Reports of a phantom house, that disappears. From legend and research the place was a town in the 1800's. There was a witch living amongst the people and they burned her alive, as she died she placed a curse of flood on the place and death on the people. On the anniversary of her death there was indeed a great flood, burying the entire town and people in it alive. if you park your car near the gates at night, a train going across the only way out, blocking you in for an hours worth of demon faces in your windows, howling screeching sounds, corpses trying to get at you, and the like. (Remember, in actuality the corpses are still underwater in the town, never recovered). You can actually walk thru this place (beware, there are wild dog packs throughout) and good luck not getting lost. If the waters low enough, you can see the tops of chimneys and houses during the day. Pay close attention to what you hear; sounds even in the daytime are unexplainable and for added fun, try the cemetery off to the left for gravesites of those who died before the flood.

Manor,United States,"The Norwin Elks used to be the old Fletcher's place. He made jellies and such assortments as that. When it closed down is when all the hauntings were noticed. . . There are 3 distinct hauntings. The first haunting is in the Old Fletcher Barn (Which became the Terror Barn). One of the groundskeepers apparently had nowhere to go when Fletcher's was shutdown, so he thought he'd make a statement to the world by hanging himself in the barn facing the window on the second floor. Working there I noticed the scariest things imaginable would happen. For one thing (and they had this on tape one night while we were making a commercial for the terror barn) the radio (which was located at the other side of the barn in the ""Michael Meyer's Room"") was changing stations rapid ply and shutting off and turning on while we are all meeting in the wizard room (on the other side of the barn, nowhere near Michael Meyers).The second thing, if you lay on the torture rack and look up you can see a man who walks the rafters above. The other thing has to do withhe sound of cowboy boots following you as you walk around. The last thing is above all the scariest, a piercing scream while we were closing one night. The second haunting of the Norwin Elks is located in the bar/dining area. Apparently in the attic there is a specter who you cannot make out, but she/he is there and watches you. Some say that it is a little girl and others say it's a little boy. The third haunting is in the basement of the Norwin Elks. If you walk down there you can hear a dog barking for hours on end, but the Norwin Elks don't have any dogs. And sometimes you see a maintenance man down there who tells you that the pipes of the furnace need a cleaning, and when you ask them what's wrong he vanishes. There are other reports of a man in the bar who never leaves and when you finally force him outside he vanishes after he leaves the door. But no one can say for certain what happened to any of these ghosts. The only ghost that we know for sure is the Fletcher's Groundskeeper in the terror barn who hung himself.",Norwin Elks,Pennsylvania,PA,-79.67394070000002,40.3551341,-79.6700433,40.333958,True,True,2025/03/03,0,Night,Ghost (Male),Supernatural,"5,703",26.2,5.52,18.5%,5.5,7.9,1.8,3.9,45.4%,69.0%,52.4%,47.6%,81.7%,2.67%,149637.0,9.544,12.885,2.59,48587.07142857143,670.5,288389.0714285714,128.0,121.0,Above Average,144.0,53.0,33.0,19.0,11.0,16.0,10.0,11.83,The_Norwin_Elks_used_to_be_the_old_Fletcher_s_plac.png,a black and white photo of a kitchen .,"cinema, movie theater, movie theatre, movie house, picture palace (0.91)","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL', 'ORDINAL', 'FAC', 'CARDINAL', 'PERSON', 'ORDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'TIME', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'ORDINAL', 'TIME', 'ORDINAL', 'FAC', 'ORDINAL', 'FAC', 'TIME', 'PERSON']","['The Norwin Elks', 'Fletcher', '3', 'first', 'the Terror Barn', 'One', 'Fletcher', 'second', 'one', 'one night', 'the ""Michael Meyer\'s', 'Michael Meyers).The', 'second', 'one night', 'second', 'the Norwin Elks', 'third', 'the Norwin Elks', 'hours', 'the Norwin Elks']",,,,"cinema, movie theater, movie theatre, movie house, picture palace (0.91)"

Mars,United States,"At the turn of the 20th Century, when the station was still fairly new, a small cat lingered in the rooms where its owner worked. It was somewhat of a mascot for the station over the next couple of years. One day, it mysteriously disappeared. When the station was moved in August of 2000, workers found a preserved body of a dead cat in the foundation. After the station was moved, members of the Mars Historical Society began experiencing strange happenings in the old structure. Cat sounds can be heard. What is even more disturbing is that during the restoration work, members discovered paw prints of a cat in the sawdust of a newly cut board.

Middletown / Lima,United States,"This county home was established in Media, Pennsylvania in 1807, where it remained until 1857. It then moved to its present location in Lima on the 210-acre Abraham Pennell Farm on Middletown Road. The farm was called ""Fair Acres"", and as a county facility it retained this name. During the early years in Lima, the County facility often cared for entire families as well as individuals in a self-contained environment. A part of this facility was the operation of a farm used for the production of food items for people within the facility. The farming operation was discontinued in 1967 when the facility underwent a transition from a partially residential community to a health care facility and directed its emphasis to elderly residents of Delaware County who required medical and nursing care. With this change, ""farm"" was dropped from the name, and in 1978 the institution became the Fair Acres Geriatric Center. The Center now consists of eighteen buildings located on a 210-acre tract in Lima, Pennsylvania. Five of these are resident buildings, containing both skilled and intermediate care nursing units with total accommodations for over 900 residents.  One building in particular, Building 4, now has many separate offices and a main hallway shared by each office.  This building was originally a big, single room that held hundreds of hospital beds in rows in the late 1800's. An elderly woman with long gray, straight hair and wearing a hospital gown has been seen walking in the hallways.  She has been seen by about 5 different people in different years.

Montrose,United States,"The site of the Inn has a long history. The original Inn was used as the first jail, as a funeral home before there was a funeral home in town and as a school room. The original building burned to the ground in the mid 1920's. When the new building was about 90 percent completed it burned to the ground again. The building that stands on the site now, was completed around 1926. Upstairs in the Inn there is a little boy that roams the hall and plays trick at all times of the day and night. He seems to like room #5 the most. More than one guest reported someone knocking on the door and no one being there when the door was opened. One guest in particular complained in the morning about the child that was staying in the Inn. He had upset here during the night with knocking on the door several times during the evening and giggling. There were no other guest in the Inn that night. The shade would be taken off the window and placed neatly on the pillow. The window was about 7 feet away from the bed. The time on the clock would be changed. The arm that was set the night before would not go off ( the alarm clock was changed in that room more than once due to the complaints concerning the alarm not going off). Room doors would open then slowly close. The child was reported as seen only once. He was crouched down with his face toward the corner with his hands over his eyes and he was giggling as though he was playing hide and seek. Downstairs in the Inn is a man that has been seen on many occasions and felt many more. This man was seen walking past the front office into the coat closet on one occasion. He seemed so real that the customer in the dinning room thought that he was about to steal a coat. The customer kept his eye on the closet until he realized that no one was coming back out so he leaned back in his chair where he could see into the closet and realized that no one was there.

Their was a little girl with her arms opened (as to give her a hug) & the woman jumped back & fell onto the guys. When the guys looked back to see what the heck was going on, they saw the ghost as well. Immediately, they took off running. The Building's power was off & just the two guy's had flash lights.

South Los Angeles,United States,"There are reports of ghostly happenings in the stock rooms of this former Zody's. It is believed that a double murder/suicide took place somewhere in the upstairs stockroom. Apparently, a couple worked together for Zody's and the boyfriend caught his girlfriend in a compromising situation with another male employee. The enraged boyfriend located a box cutter and slashed the two to death. He then slashed his own wrists and carotid artery. After several reports from employees of unusual activity, Kmart headquarters in Michigan has admitted to hiring paranormal/paraphysical investigators to conduct investigations into the incident. The conclusion was that indeed the building was occupied by several spirits. The investigators concluded that four different spirits dwell throughout the building. The fourth has not been linked to any known incident that may have occurred and thus is unknown for its presence. Kmart has remained quiet on the findings of this investigation and resources revealed that employees of this store are not advised of this activity. Prior to changing over to Kmart, Zody's employees reported seeing a man walking about in the stockroom. A woman is also seen running and sometimes screams are heard. In one case, an overnight employee sustained a 7 inch laceration while working in the stockroom. Zody's management insisted that the incident was just an accident caused by falling boxes that were stacked too high, but resources close to the victim tell another tale. A paring knife mysteriously came across the room and cut the employee across the chest. No one was seen in the area. The victim survived his wounds, but obviously resigned from the company.

Whittier,United States,"large Building built in 1903. Once used as an old Citrus packinghouse in the early 1900's. Now housing a Antique Mall since 1979 with 4 floors inside. The former Owners and Staff as well as the dealers experienced strange happenings. Two the stories are that 2 citrus plant workers died tragically in the mall. One story is that a worker had locked himself accidentally in the old freezer room in the basement and passed away. Another is unknown how but a worker died from machinery falling onto him in the back of the bottom floor. Dark shadowy figures have been seen in closing time. The cleaning crew has quit after hours when a woman cleaner screamed from the bottom floor claiming she saw a black figure watching her. Electrical appliances have sounded off with no batteries inside. Pictures have fallen feet away from where they were hung. Saucers and objects for sell have rolled or flung off onto the floors. A empty space has got the most attention where stairs use to be, cold spots and sensitive customers have felt a presence there. Curiously young children who know nothing of the mall refuse sometimes to enter the basement where the freezer accident occurred. King Richards is history all around and the staff claims that they feel no threat from the strange occurrences. Sometimes you just feel like they want to be noticed or known. Oddly enough the happenings really become more active around October through the holiday season. Its hard to separate the occurrences said one worker. the Antique items that are brought in by dealers some time hold a past with them as well. But for the feeling of King Richards you see, to know the difference. No harm from these ghost's just a remembrance of Whittiers History.",King Richards Antique Center.

Tommy still haunts the area above the auditorium, which has long been sealed up and used for storage. He is mischievous for the most part, making noises, moving things, and causing unexplainable problems in the theater. Technicians working on tall ladders swear they can feel Tommy putting a pressure on their backs. They claim that it is Tommy trying to prevent any one else from falling. December 2003 correction:The actual story is this: It was in the '70's when it happened, and the boy that fell wasn't a child, he was a teenager.The boy that died was named Tommy. Tommy and few other kids had been drinking and they snuck into the auditorium. They were fooling around, jumping on seats, rolling around on the stage, etc. When the kids where getting ready to leave, but they couldn't find Tommy. They figured that he had left and so they left.

Oceanside,United States,"The Hunter Steakhouse in Oceanside, California sits on a hill above the Buena Vista Lagoon. The land it sits on was originally the site of the Buena Vista Cemetery, and it seems that not all the spirits followed when the graves were moved. Patrons and employees have constantly reported incidents. The stairwell to the bar area appears to be the home of a female spirit. There is a storage room above the lower dining area and entrance. The room is constantly locked and hardly used. But for some reason the spirits prefer this location when the restaurant gets busy. There are three windows up there, and although they can't be opened, people feel drawn to gaze at these windows. Also from the second floor an apparition has been reported moving across the room from the fireplace in mid-air. Several people have heard there names called by both male and female voices. Like many other locations of hauntings, objects moving and power surges have been reported as well.
